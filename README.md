## Functionality
Bitminers 2 creates that complex money making system that many servers lack. With three different types of Bitminers to choose from, all with different speeds, players don't need a lot of money to start mining legally. All Bitminers require a generator for power, don't forget to refuel the generator though!

### Components
Components can be powered using power cables which is attached to the back of the components. An extention lead may be used which hooks up to the generator and can support several Bitminers but fuel in the generator is consumed faster.

### Interacting with the Terminal
Using the terminal on a Bitminer may seem complex but it's actually really simple. To start/stop the Bitminer, input 'mining [start/stop]' and then it will continue to mine Bitcoins as long as theres a generator attached to it containing sufficient fuel. In order to sell your mined Bitcoins, type into the Bitminer terminal 'bitcoin sell', the value of a Bitcoin can be modified in the config file.

### Upgrades
On every Bitminer, different upgrades are avaliable. Simply accessed by inputting 'upgrade' into the Bitminer terminal and then typing the number of the upgrade you wish to purchase (typing just 'upgrade', the list of avaliable upgrades can be viewed).
